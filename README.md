# Advent Of Code

A collection of all my solutions to the challenges of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) over the years, all in Go.
Solutions will only be posted 24 hours after each challenge started.

## 2021 (8⭐)
This year I will again refresh my knowledge of Go, as I mostly used Rust and a bit of Python and C++ recently.

## 2020 (50⭐)
I used the 2020 Advent of Code to refresh my knowledge of the Go programming language.
This worked rather well.
Because of this I was able to rather quickly rewrite the complete codebase of my [online travel planner](http://travelbetter.app) from Rust into Go.

## 2019 (13⭐)
Using these as a preparation for the 2021 AoC.

## 2017 (37⭐)
I used the 2017 Advent of Code to first learn the Go programming language.

## 2015 (50⭐)
Originally, I solved these challenges in C++ (I think); it is now over 5 years since.
Now I started solving these again, this time in Go.
